# Advent of Code 2020

This repository is my participation to the [Advent of Code](adventofcode.com) 2020.
My goal is to improve my Rust skills, and make good code that run fast.

I focus on:

- Make readable and "production-ready" code, with unit tests, short and explicit
  functions, etc...

- Make it fast: it is possible to benchmark each part of each challenge with
  `cargo +nightly --features=nightly bench`. The benchmarks does not take the
  parsing step in account, only the problem solving step.

Of course I will eventually be tired of this and rush some challenge, but ðŸ¤«
